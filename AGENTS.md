# AGENTS.md for hugo-theme-hibi

<INSTRUCTIONS>
## Local skills
- Local skills live under `.codex/skills/` in this repository.
- Each skill must have a `SKILL.md` file (case-sensitive) as the entrypoint.
- Do not read or execute skills outside this repository unless explicitly requested.

## Usage
- If a task matches a local skill description or the user names a skill, load the skill's `SKILL.md` and follow it.
- Keep context small; only open files referenced by the skill as needed.
