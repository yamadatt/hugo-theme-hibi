Hello. I'm Yuki, a designer living quietly in a small corner of Tokyo. 
For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by the beauty of "less."
Whether it's the interface of a digital product or the arrangement of objects on a desk, 
I believe that clarity brings peace.

This blog, <span class="italic text-primary">Life Log</span>, is a collection of my daily observations. 
It serves as a digital garden where I cultivate thoughts on minimalism, technology, and the 
often overlooked quiet moments of city life. I write not to teach, but to remember and reflect.

When I'm not designing interfaces, you can find me brewing coffee, exploring old bookstores in Jimbocho, 
or simply walking without a destination. I hope my words can offer you a brief moment of calm 
in your busy day.
